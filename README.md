# GMTK_gamejam22
An entry for the Game Maker's Toolkit game jam 22

The theme is "Roll of the dice". We implement this theme as a randomly generated forest. There will also be a literal roll of the dice when determining the number of children in your nest.

You play as a magpie parent trying to feed your children. Feed them enough and they grow up and leave the nest. If you let them go too hungry, you will lose your children.
